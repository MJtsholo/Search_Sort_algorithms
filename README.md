Searching refers to looking for a specific data point (e.g., a number) in a data structure. Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format. Sorting algorithm specifies the way to arrange data in a particular order, such as numerical (1234…) or alphabetical (abcd…) order. Search and sort algorithms differ in efficiency, so it is important to know how they work.
